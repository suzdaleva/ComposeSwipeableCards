# ComposeSwipeableCards

Tinder-like swipeable deck of cards built on Jetpack Compose.

Cards are draggable in any direction.

The user can return to the previous card by tapping on the top card.

It is a pretty straightforward solution, which can be modifier and adjusted in a number of ways, for instance, by regulating easing and duration in AnimationSpec.
